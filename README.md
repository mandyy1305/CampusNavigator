# Campus Navigator

**Campus Navigator** is an innovative navigation tool built in Unity2D, designed to help users find the shortest routes between buildings on the campus of Dayananda Sagar College of Engineering (DSCE). With an aerial view map and the use of algorithms like A* and NavMesh, the app provides efficient pathways for users to navigate the vast campus easily.

## 🚀 About the Project

In **Campus Navigator**, users can input their starting and destination buildings, and the application will calculate and display the shortest route using A* algorithm and Unity's NavMesh system. The project aims to assist students, faculty, and visitors in efficiently moving across the large DSCE campus.
